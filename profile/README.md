## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We are working to make space exploration fun.

By building opensource solution for modeling, analysys and simulation of extraterrestrial missions.

It's a precise tool/game:
1. Hardcore mode - realistic simulations, could be used by space agencies to plan their mission.
2. Arcade mode â€“ sandbox like SimCity, KSP where your goal is to build spacecraft from Lunar resources (ISRU)
